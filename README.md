# brainmapp
Interactive application for visualising and inspecting vertex-wise statistical analyses.
The app generates **3D brain surface maps** based on a given results directory. The results directory should contain the 
output generated by QDECR or verywise.

### Running the application locally 
The 3D brain surface reconstructions (especially the high-resolution ones) may be faster to compute on your local machine. 
To run the application locally (assuming a UNIX system with Python installed), copy the following lines into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/SereDef/brainmapp

pip install -r requirements.txt

shiny run --launch-browser app.py
```
